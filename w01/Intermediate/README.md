# Intermediate Project

Intermediate developers should already be familiar with the basics of the `os` module, so your challenge is to turn this into an installable CLI (Command Line Interface) tool.

You may use any of the many CLI libraries to assist in building this application. As a minimum product, your CLI tool should be able to run without any arguments and just list the contents of the current directory. As an added challenge, make the output print in a multi-column format similar to the output of the `ls` command on Linux based systems. You should also allow an argument that points to the directory you want to print the contents of.

## Intermediate Stretch Goal

Add an option to list the details of the files, line-by-line. For example, list the file size, created date, owner, etc. Print the results in a multi-column table, with each file on its own line.
