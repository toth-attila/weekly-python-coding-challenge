# Advanced Project

Recreate the `ls` command from scratch and add some modern twists. Colorize the output to make it easier to read, show all extended attributes, allow the "long view" attributes to display multiple columns if the terminal is wide enough. The `ls` command does a **LOT**, so implement as much of it as you can in the next week!

## Advanced Stretch Goal

Use `asyncio` to concurrently gather extended attributes of each file and improve performance. You need to build on Python 3.7+ to take advantage of this.
