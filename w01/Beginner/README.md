# Beginner Project

As a beginner, you should use this project to familiarize yourself with the `os` module in python. You will need to familiarize yourself with the concept of a `"directory"` and a `"current working directory"`.

Your challenge is to create a python script that will print the names of every file in the directory you run it from in alphabetical order. For this challenge, we only want to see the names of files and not include folders in the returned list. Also, make sure the list is printed with one file per line of output.

## Beginner Stretch Goal

Add a command-line argument to also include the names of every folder in the current working directory.
